1. Ensure the Visual Studios Compiler PATH is up to date in your environment variables
 ex.
 - C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\bin
 - C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\

2. Open the command line to the project and type the following command to initialize the visual studios compiler variables.
 - vcvarsall

3. Run the 'build' command to build the project
 - currently there may be a linker warning on first compilation, IGNORE THIS and COMPILE AGAIN it doesnt do anything.
 - it is most likely due to one of the includes for the DirectXTK library.

4. Run the program by executing main.exe either from command line or windows explorer.
